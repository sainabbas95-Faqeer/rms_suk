# Entries Display Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Entries were not visible in the table view when clicking on dashboard cards
2. Column mapping in table_view.html was incorrect, causing data to not display properly
3. Potential CSS overflow issues that could hide content

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Corrected Column Mapping in table_view.html
- Updated column indices to match the actual structure of the Excel file:
  * Site Id: Column A (index 0)
  * Sub Region: Column B (index 1)
  * Cluster: Column C (index 2)
  * Team Lead: Column D (index 3)
  * ES POC: Column E (index 4)
  * Offline Date: Column F (index 5)
  * Days Passed (Aging): Column G (index 6)
  * Reason: Column H (index 7)
  * Domain: Column L (index 11)

### 2. Enhanced Data Filtering Logic
- Improved the shouldIncludeRecord function to properly handle:
  * Region filtering with support for "Jacob Abad"/"Jacobabad" variations
  * Domain filtering for both "Enfra" and "SMS LD" domains
  * Aging filtering with proper range matching
  * Reason filtering with case-insensitive matching

### 3. Fixed CSS Overflow Issues
- Updated CSS in table_view.html to ensure content visibility:
  * Changed body overflow to "auto"
  * Changed container overflow to "visible"
  * Changed table-container overflow to "visible"
  * Changed table-scroll overflow to "auto"

### 4. Created Test File
- Created test_entries_fix.html to verify the fixes work correctly

## Files Modified
1. table_view.html - Updated column mapping and CSS
2. test_entries_fix.html - Created for testing the fixes

## Verification Steps
1. Open the dashboard (index.html)
2. Load or upload DB.xlsx data
3. Click on any card or filter to open the table view
4. Verify that entries are now visible in the table
5. Check that the correct columns are displayed (Site Id, Sub Region, Cluster, Team Lead, ES POC, etc.)

## Expected Results
- Entries should now be visible when clicking on dashboard cards
- Data should display in the correct columns
- Table should be scrollable and not clipped
- Filtering should work correctly for all criteria
