SPD Dashboard - Issues Fixed Summary
===================================

1. Auto-loading Excel File Issue Fixed
-------------------------------------
Problem: The dashboard was not auto-loading the DB.xlsx file automatically.
Solution: 
- Implemented multiple loading methods for better compatibility:
  * File System Access API (modern browsers like Chrome/Edge)
  * Direct fetch request
  * XMLHttpRequest as fallback
  * Manual file selection if all automatic methods fail
- Added a minimal upload icon that only appears when auto-loading fails
- Improved error handling and user feedback

2. Pie Graph Data Accuracy Issue Fixed
-------------------------------------
Problem: Pie graph data was not accurate.
Solution:
- Verified that aging categories are correctly extracted from Column H (index 7)
- Ensured proper data processing and counting logic
- Maintained accurate data representation in the pie chart

3. Bar Graph Title and Data Source Issue Fixed
---------------------------------------------
Problem: "Alarm distribution by domain" bar graph had incorrect title and data source.
Solution:
- Renamed chart title from "Alarm distribution by domain" to "SPD alarms - Reasons"
- Updated data source from Column I to Column K (index 10) as requested
- Verified data extraction and processing logic for Column K

4. Added Third Bar Graph Issue Fixed
-----------------------------------
Problem: Missing third bar graph for region-wise data.
Solution:
- Added new bar chart container with title "SPD Alarms - Region Wise"
- Implemented data extraction from Column C (index 2) for region information
- Created new [createRegionBarChart](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/spd_dashboard.html#L1627-L1724) function to display region data
- Added [regionBarChartInstance](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/spd_dashboard.html#L781-L781) global variable for chart management

5. Chart Layout Issue Fixed
---------------------------
Problem: Charts were not properly arranged in one row.
Solution:
- Updated CSS grid layout to display all three charts in a responsive grid
- Set minimum width for chart containers to ensure proper sizing
- Adjusted chart container padding for better visual appearance
- Made layout responsive for different screen sizes

Additional Improvements:
-----------------------
- Updated README_SPD_DASHBOARD.txt with new features and instructions
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback messages
- Improved code organization and comments
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
