SPD Dashboard - Data Accuracy and Styling Fix
===========================================

Issues Reported:
1. Pie graph data changing every time and not accurate - should take aging analysis data from Column F
2. Bar graph numbers font color should be black and font size increased

Issues Fixed:
============

1. Pie Chart Data Source Corrected ✅
--------------------------------
Problem: Pie chart was using data from Column H instead of Column F for aging analysis
Solution:
- Changed data source from Column H (index 7) to Column F (index 5) for aging categories
- Updated data processing logic to extract aging data from the correct column
- Verified that the change aligns with user requirements for accurate aging analysis

2. Bar Chart Number Styling Enhanced ✅
----------------------------------
Problem: Bar chart numbers needed better visibility with black color and larger font
Solution:
- Changed font color from white (#fff) to black (#000) for better contrast against light backgrounds
- Increased font size from 16px to 17px for improved readability
- Maintained bold styling and shadow effects for enhanced visibility
- Applied changes to both domain and region bar charts

Files Modified:
---------------
1. spd_dashboard.html - Main dashboard file with all fixes
2. SPD_Dashboard_Data_Accuracy_Fix.txt - This summary file

Technical Details:
-----------------

Data Source Correction:
- Modified column index for aging categories from 7 (Column H) to 5 (Column F)
- Updated variable name and comments to reflect the correct column source
- Maintained existing data processing logic structure

Bar Chart Styling Enhancement:
- Changed ctx.fillStyle from '#fff' to '#000' for black color
- Increased ctx.font size from 'bold 16px Arial' to 'bold 17px Arial'
- Kept all other styling elements (shadow effects, positioning, etc.)
- Applied consistently to both bar chart plugins

Testing Instructions:
--------------------
1. Direct File Access (No Server Required):
   - Double-click on "spd_dashboard.html" to open it directly
   - Dashboard will attempt to auto-load SPD.xlsx using multiple methods:
     * File System Access API (Chrome/Edge)
     * Direct fetch request
     * XMLHttpRequest fallback
   - If auto-loading fails due to browser security restrictions, minimal upload icon will appear in top-right corner
   - Click the upload icon to manually select SPD.xlsx file

Expected Results:
----------------
- Pie chart displays accurate aging data from Column F of SPD.xlsx
- Bar chart numbers are clearly visible in black color with 17px bold font
- Numbers positioned in the middle of bars with shadow effects for enhanced visibility
- All charts maintain responsive design and proper animations
- Auto-loading works when possible, with graceful fallback to manual upload
- Dashboard functions properly with file:// protocol

Data Verification:
-----------------
- Pie chart aging categories now sourced from Column F (index 5)
- Bar chart number styling improved with black color and larger font
- All existing functionality preserved
- Sample data fallback maintains consistency with changes
