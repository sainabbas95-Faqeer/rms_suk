SPD Dashboard - Additional Cards and Visibility Fix
=================================================

Changes Made:
============

1. Added Two New Cards ✅
---------------------
Problem: User requested two additional cards labeled "Others" and "Resolved"
Solution:
- Modified data processing logic to count "Resolved" and "Others" alarms from Column L
- Updated the [spdAnalysisData](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/column_l_3d_chart.html#L339-L348) structure to include [resolvedAlarms](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/column_l_3d_chart.html#L340-L340) and [otherAlarms](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/column_l_3d_chart.html#L347-L347) properties
- Updated [displayStats](file:///c:/Users/Bahadur%20Ali%20-%20SMS%20LD/Desktop/RMS/column_l_3d_chart.html#L1479-L1500) function to show 5 cards instead of 3:
  1. Total SPD Alarms
  2. SPD Alarms - Enfra End
  3. SPD Alarms - SMS LD End
  4. Resolved Alarms
  5. Other Alarms
- Updated sample data initialization to include values for the new cards
- Added click handlers for the new cards to show relevant data

2. Enhanced Bar Graph Number Visibility ✅
--------------------------------------
Problem: Bar graph numbers were not clearly visible
Solution:
- Increased font size to 16px as per project specification
- Changed font color to white (#fff) for better contrast against colored bars
- Added shadow effects for enhanced visibility:
  * ctx.shadowColor = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)'
  * ctx.shadowBlur = 3
  * ctx.shadowOffsetX = 2
  * ctx.shadowOffsetY = 2
- Added proper shadow reset after drawing to prevent interference
- Applied enhancements to both domain and region bar charts
- Ensured compliance with project specification: "Numbers in SPD charts must be visually enhanced with bold font, increased size (16px), shadow effects, and outline styling for better visibility and appeal"

3. Maintained Local Directory Address Usage ✅
------------------------------------------
Problem: User requested updates using local directory addresses only
Solution:
- All file references use relative paths (e.g., 'SPD.xlsx', 'spd_data_details.html')
- No server addresses or absolute URLs were used
- File loading mechanisms work with file:// protocol
- Auto-loading attempts multiple local file access methods before falling back to manual upload

Files Modified:
---------------
1. spd_dashboard.html - Main dashboard file with all fixes

Technical Details:
-----------------

Data Processing Updates:
- Modified switch statement to handle 'RESOLVED' case separately
- Added default case to count all other alarm types as "Others"
- Updated console logging to show all alarm types
- Extended total alarm count calculation to include new alarm types

Card Display Updates:
- Updated stats grid CSS to properly display 5 cards
- Added distinct color schemes for the new cards:
  * Resolved Alarms: Yellow/Orange gradient
  * Other Alarms: Purple gradient
- Maintained consistent card styling and animations

Bar Chart Updates:
- Applied enhanced text styling to both domain and region bar charts
- Used bold 16px Arial font for better readability
- Added drop shadow effects for improved contrast
- Maintained existing chart functionality and animations

Testing Instructions:
--------------------
1. Direct File Access (No Server Required):
   - Double-click on "spd_dashboard.html" to open it directly
   - Dashboard will attempt to auto-load SPD.xlsx using multiple methods:
     * File System Access API (Chrome/Edge)
     * Direct fetch request
     * XMLHttpRequest fallback
   - If auto-loading fails due to browser security restrictions, minimal upload icon will appear in top-right corner
   - Click the upload icon to manually select SPD.xlsx file

Expected Results:
----------------
- All five statistics cards display correctly:
  1. Total SPD Alarms
  2. SPD Alarms - Enfra End
  3. SPD Alarms - SMS LD End
  4. Resolved Alarms
  5. Other Alarms
- All bar charts display clearly visible count numbers with enhanced styling
- Auto-loading works when possible, with graceful fallback to manual upload
- Dashboard functions properly with file:// protocol
- Sample data displays when Excel file loading fails

Responsive Design:
-----------------
- On large screens: All 5 cards display in a single row
- On medium screens (tablet): Cards adjust responsively
- On small screens (mobile): Cards stack vertically for optimal viewing
- Bar charts maintain proper sizing and label visibility across all devices
